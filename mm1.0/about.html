        <p class="about-paragraph">And I would like to share my journey with you.</p>
        <p class="about-paragraph">It took me a while to realize that my life's story was hardly unique. That many others experience depression as well.</p>
        <p class="about-paragraph">I want to share my experiences and shed light on the battles I faced along the way. The lessons I learned.</p>
        <p class="about-paragraph">A boss of mine once said <q>Your 20's is about what you <em>learn</em>. Your 30's is about what you <em>earn</em></q>.</p>
        <p class="about-paragraph">And if I've learned anything in my 20's thus far, it's how to find happiness and purpose in life. I hope you do too.</p>
